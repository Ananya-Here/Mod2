                <p>
                   Pierre Hermé (born 20 November 1961) is a French pastry chef and chocolatier. Pierre Hermé began his career at the age of 14 as an apprentice to Gaston Lenôtre. He was awarded the title of World's Best Pastry Chef in 2016 by the World's 50 Best Restaurants and as the fourth most influential French person in the World by Vanity Fair in 2016. Pierre Hermé created his own brand in 1998 with Charles Znaty. Preferring discreet pastry decors and "uses sugar like salt, in other words, as a seasoning to heighten other shades of flavour" and refusing to sit on his laurels, he is always revising his own work, exploring new taste territories and revisiting his own recipes.

                 The French word ‘naturalité’ indicates something that belongs to nature and it is this basic principle that underpins Alain Ducasse’s cookery. Through his cuisine, the French chef says that he strives to preserve an ingredient’s most beautiful ‘naturality’, in order to create the best expression of its innate qualities. When she joined Alain Ducasse au Plaza Athénée as pastry chef in 2015, Jessica Préalpato found harmony in this philosophy.
                    
Three years and a half later, Préalpato is the author of a book exploring her own pastry style and the winner of The World’s Best Pastry Chef Award 2019, sponsored by Sosa. In this time, she realised that Ducasse’s principle could be applied to sweet as easily as it does to savoury – and where the two styles met, ‘desseralité’ was born.

                <h2> Dominique Ansel </h2>
                <p>
                    Dominique Ansel is a French-American pastry chef and owner of Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York City. He is best known for his invention of the cronut, a croissant-donut hybrid that became a phenomenon. Raised in a working-class family in Beauvais, a small a north of Paris, Ansel is the youngest of four children. After high school, he apprenticed at local restaurants, first working in savory and then in pastry, gravitating most strongly to the scientific precision of pastry. At age 19, Ansel did his military service in French Guiana as part of a community program teaching locals how to cook.
